# Attendance-Monitoring-System
In this project, we tried to automate the attendance of our college. We used machine learning to identify the faces of the students present in the class and mark their attendance. Our system has the following features:
a) Online portal connected to database for students where they can timely check their attendance in different subjects by logging onto their account.
b) Online portal for teachers to check the attandance of their students.
c) A full fleged working application where teacher can login and give command to take picture of class, identify the faces of students present and mark their attendance in database.
